4. Drag and drop to reorder fields
5. Click **Save** to save your form as a draft

### 2. Publish a Form

1. After saving, click **Publish** button
2. The form will be published and accessible to users
3. You'll be redirected to the dashboard

### 3. Share Your Form

1. Go to the dashboard
2. Find your published form
3. Click **Copy Link** to copy the form URL
4. Share the link with users

### 4. View Submissions

2. Use the **View** button to see the live form
3. Submissions are stored in the database

## Form Workflow

```
Create Form → Save Draft → Preview → Publish → Share Link → Collect Submissions
```

## Troubleshooting

### Form Submission Not Working

**Problem**: Users can't submit forms
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure the form is published (`isPublished: true`)
2. Check the browser console for errors
3. Verify the API endpoint `/api/forms/[id]/submissions` is working
4. Test with the `/test` page

### Copy Link Not Working

**Problem**: Can't copy form links to clipboard
**Solution**:
1. The system now has fallback methods for clipboard access
2. If clipboard fails, a prompt will show the link for manual copying
3. Make sure you're using HTTPS (clipboard API requires secure context)

### Form Status Not Visible

**Problem**: Can't see if form is saved/published
**Solution**:
1. Check the dashboard for form status indicators
2. Look for "Published" or "Draft" badges
3. Check the form's `publishedAt` timestamp
4. Use the builder's save/publish buttons with visual feedback

### After Save/Publish Redirect Issues

**Problem**: Confusion about what happens after saving/publishing
**Solution**:
1. **Save**: Keeps you in the builder, shows success message
2. **Publish**: Shows success message, then redirects to dashboard after 2 seconds
3. Check the status messages above the buttons for feedback

## API Endpoints

### Forms
- `GET /api/forms` - List all forms
- `POST /api/forms` - Create new form
- `GET /api/forms/[id]` - Get specific form
- `PUT /api/forms/[id]` - Update form
- `DELETE /api/forms/[id]` - Delete form

### Publishing
- `POST /api/forms/[id]/publish` - Publish/unpublish form

### Submissions
- `GET /api/forms/[id]/submissions` - Get form submissions
- `POST /api/forms/[id]/submissions` - Submit form data

## Database Schema

The system uses three main tables:
- `forms` - Form metadata and settings
- `form_fields` - Individual form fields and their properties
- `form_submissions` - User form responses

## Testing

Use the `/test` page to test form submission functionality:
1. Create and publish a form first
2. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` in the test page with the actual form ID
3. Submit the test form to verify everything works

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Form is not published" Error
- Make sure to click **Publish** after saving
- Check the form's `isPublished` status in the database

### "Form not found" Error
- Verify the form ID in the URL
- Check if the form exists in the database

### Network Errors
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API endpoints are accessible
- Check browser console for CORS issues

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`
- Make sure PostgreSQL is running
- Check if the database exists and is accessible
